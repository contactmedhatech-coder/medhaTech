Build:

If you use npm:

npm install
npm run build


Confirm you now have a folder:

dist/ (most likely)

Commit and push the dist folder
Important: many projects ignore dist/ in .gitignore. If it’s ignored, remove that line.

Then:

git add dist -f
git commit -m "Add production build"
git push origin main
